\section*{Introduction}

Dengue is a disease which is caused by 4 different types of viruses 
which co-circulate between the vector and human populations. Immunity is 
considered permanent after the exposure of humans to each of the viruses and 
cross immunity is considered very limited\cite{halstead_dengue_2007}.
Thus, the proportions of viral types co-circulating at any point in time is 
strongly dependent on previous incidence of the disease, which determines the 
number of susceptibles for each viral type at any point in time.

Dengue transmission is modulated by environmental conditions, of which 
temperature, due to its effects on the 
vector reproduction, stands out as a strong predictor of 
incidence~\cite{honorio_temporal_2009,wu_higher_2009}.
In places with sufficient temperature variation dengue is predominantly a 
summer disease. So it is fair to say that these environmental fluctuations play 
a key role in determining beginning and end of epidemic periods through its 
effects on the force of infection, which cannot be taken as 
constant\cite{reiner_time-varying_2014}

The long term dynamics of dengue is also modulated by the alternation of virus 
types in circulation. Demographics also plays a role in replenishing the 
population of susceptibles. 

The Attack ratio of disease is a measure of morbidity defined as the number of 
new cases divided by the population at risk.
For Dengue outbreaks and epidemics this can be difficult to calculated due to 
the lack of information about the population at risk. The population at risk in 
the case of dengue, is the number of susceptibles to the circulating virus 
type(s) before a given epidemic.

The main source of information about Dengue dynamics are the incidence 
time series, which represent all the cases of Dengue reported by health 
professionals with no discrimination of virus types.
Only a very small sample 
of the cases are ever examined to determined the virus type.

In order to calculate the attack ratio, we need to determine the number of 
susceptibles to the circulating virus types right before the epidemic.
Without 
regular virological surveys, it is virtually impossible to determine the 
population at risk.

The attack ratio is also influenced by the reproductive number of the disease 
~\cite{bacaer_final_2009, katriel_attack_2012}.
With Dengue, since transmission 
is affected by environmental conditions as discussed above, the reproductive 
number is also expected to vary with time.

Various challenges exist to assess the attack rate of a dengue epidemic. 
One of 
them is that there are a large number of asymptomatic cases in any epidemic, 
which nevertheless acquire immunity.
It is estimated that for 
every case reported, 10-20 are not seen by health authorities (personnal 
communication).
Thirdly, under-reporting is a serious issue in Brazil. 
Duarte and Fran\c{c}a (2006)~\cite{duarte_data_2006}, estimated 
the sensitivity of dengue reporting for hospitalized patients in 
Belo-Horizonte, Brazil to be of 63\%, 
meaning that approximately 37\% of the suspected dengue cases go unreported.  
Lastly, demography and migrations affect the number of susceptible in ways which 
are not easy to determine.


In this paper, we estimate the number of susceptibles before every major 
outbreak ($S_{0, year}$) in the last 18 years.
Due to the alternation of circulating serotypes, we detected fluctuating levels 
of susceptibility the circulating virus(es).
To estimate the susceptibles we have we have fixed the 
transmissibility based on the $R_t$ series derived from data~\cite{nishiura}. 
Then, 
from the incidence series and the population at risk, we could then calculate 
the attack ratio for each epidemic.

To accomplish the estimation of the $S_0$, we use a simplified model of 
dengue transmission based on a single-strain Susceptible-Infecctious-Removed 
(SIR) model.
The reason for the choice of a single strain model, is the lack of 
accurate information regarding the actual proportions of each virus in 
circulation.
However, some information is available about the predominant 
serotypes for some epidemics in the period 
of study~\cite{macedo_virological_2013}. 

Methods for estimating the  number of susceptibles have been proposed 
before, for other diseases~\cite{bjornstad_dynamics_2002, 
wallinga_reconstruction_2003}.
These methods try to reconstruct the entire 
series of infectious and susceptibles for measles 
outbreaks from case data.
In the case of Dengue, the full (multi-year/multi-epidemic)
series of susceptibles to all possible serotypes, cannot be reconstructed based 
solely on a deterministic transmission model, since the arrival/re-emergenge of 
new serotypes (which are a stochastic events) can change drastically the pool 
of susceptibles throwing off any sequential estimation based on the incidence
dynamics.

The authors have applied similar methods as used here, to estimate the number 
of susceptibles for the predominant strain of Influenza at the beginning of  
Influenza seasons in europe~\cite{pone2011}.


\section*{Methods}



In this section we will start by describing the data and then the method used 
to estimate the effective reproductive number, $R_t$, from the data and obtain 
its posterior distribution. 
We then proceed to describe Susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model 
used to represent the global disease incidence and how $R_t$ can be integrated 
into the model to allow for time varying transmission. 
Next, an approach to approximate the posterior distributions 
of the numbers of susceptible to the main circulating Dengue viruses for each 
epidemic is detailed.
Finally, we discuss how to estimate the attack ratio of each 
epidemic using the estimated susceptible fraction and observed incidence.


\subsection{The dataset} 
The data used in this paper consists of  Dengue weekly notified cases time 
series for the city of Rio de Janeiro from 1996 to 2014. The cases are notified 
based only on clinical symptoms. Laboratory confirmation and serotype 
information are available only for a very small sample and only on recent 
years (2010-2013). The incidence is normalized for the parameter estimation 
procedures. The normalizatio was done by dividing the number os cases reported 
by the total city population at each year as given by the census.

\subsection*{Estimating the effective reproductive number ($R_t$)}

In monitoring of infectious diseases, it is important to assess whether the 
incidence of a  particular disease is increasing significantly, in order to 
decide to take preventive measures.
The effective reproductive number at time $t$, \rr, can be understood as a 
real-time estimate of the basic reproductive number ($R_{0}$) and is defined as 
the average number of secondary cases per primary case at time $t$.

Let $Y_t$ be the number of reported disease cases for a particular time $t \in 
(0, T)$.
Nishiura el al. (2010)~\cite{nishiura} extend the theory developed by 
Stallybrass et al. (1931)~\cite{stallybrass} and propose to estimate \rr as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Rtestimate}
R_t = \left( \frac{Y_{t+1}}{Y_t}\right)^{1/n}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is taken to be the ratio between the length of reporting interval and 
the mean generation time of the disease.
Here we are interested in the simpler case $n=1$.
If \rr is to be used as a decision tool, however, one needs to be able to 
quantify the 
uncertainty about estimate in equation~\ref{eq:Rtestimate}. 
Here we detail how to obtain credibility intervals for \rr under the assumption 
that the counts $Y_t$ are Poisson distributed for all $t$.

We explore the approach of Ederer and Mantel~\cite{mantel}, whose objective is 
to obtain 
confidence intervals for the ratio of two Poisson counts. 
Let $Y_{t} \sim Poisson(\lambda_t)$ and $Y_{t+1} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{t+1})$ 
and define $S = Y_{t} + Y_{t+1}$.
The authors note that by conditioning on the sum $S$
\begin{align}
\label{eq:binlike}
Y_{t+1} | S &\sim Binomial(S, \theta_t) \\
\theta_t &= \frac{\lambda_{t+1}}{\lambda_{t} + \lambda_{t+1}}
\end{align}
Let $c_{\alpha}(\theta_t) = \{\theta_t^{(L)} , \theta_t^{(U)} \}$ be such that 
$Pr(\theta_t^{(L)}<\theta_t <\theta_t^{(U)}) = \alpha$.
Analogously, define $c_{\alpha}(R_t) = \{R_t^{(L)} , R_t^{(U)} \}$ such that 
$Pr(R_t^{(L)}<R_t<R_t^{(U)}) = \alpha$.
Ederer and Mantel (1974)~\cite{mantel} show that one can construct a $100\alpha 
\%$ confidence interval for \rr by noting that
\begin{align}
\label{eq:confRt}
 R_t^{(L)} &= \frac{\theta_t^{(L)}}{(1-\theta_t^{(L)})}\nonumber \\
 R_t^{(U)} &= \frac{\theta_t^{(U)}}{(1-\theta_t^{(U)})}
\end{align}
Many authors have derived $c_{\alpha}(\theta_t)$ following orthodox approaches  
(see for example~\cite{wilson} and~\cite{clopper}) mainly for simplicity.
We choose instead to take a Bayesian approach and use the  $100\alpha \%$ 
posterior credibility interval for $\theta_t$ as $c_{\alpha}(\theta_t)$.
If we choose the conjugate beta prior with parameters $a_0$ and $b_0$ for the 
binomial likelihood in (\ref{eq:binlike}), the posterior distribution for 
$\theta_t$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thetapost}
p(\theta_t| Y_{t+1}, S) \sim Beta(Y_{t+1} + a_0, Y_t + b_0)
\end{equation}
Combining equations~(\ref{eq:confRt}) and~(\ref{eq:thetapost}) 
tells us that the induced posterior distribution of $R_t$ is 
a beta prime (or inverted beta) with parameters $ a_1 = Y_{t+1} + a_0$ and $b_1 
=  Y_t + b_0$.
The density of the induced distribution is then 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:densityMantel}
f_P(R_t| a_1, b_1) = \frac{\Gamma(a_1 + b_1)}{\Gamma(a_1)\Gamma(b_1)} R_t^{a_1 - 
1} (1 + R_t)^{-(a_1 + b_1)}
\end{equation}
Thus, the expectation of \rr is $a_1/(b_1 - 1)$ and its variance is 
$a_1(a_1 + b_1 - 1)/\left((b_1 - 2)(b_1 - 1)^2 \right) $.
Sampling from the posterior in~(\ref{eq:densityMantel}) can be made 
straightforward by first sampling from~(\ref{eq:thetapost}) and then applying 
the transform in~(\ref{eq:confRt}).
Also, one can choose $a_0$ and $b_0$ so as to elicit meaningful prior distributions
for $R_t$.
We show how to elicit the prior for $R_t$ from specified prior mean and variance
or coefficient of variation in Text S1.

Also, since $R_t > 1$ indicates sustained transmission, one may be 
interested in computing the probability of this event.
This can be easily achieved by integrating~(\ref{eq:densityMantel}) over the 
appropriate interval.
By noting that
\begin{align}
\label{cumprobMantel}
Pr(R_t > 1) &= 1 - \int_0^1 f_P(r)dr \\
            &= 1- Pr(\theta_t < \frac{1}{2})
\end{align}
one can compute the desired probability while avoiding dealing with the density 
in~(\ref{eq:densityMantel}) directly.

\subsection*{Mathematical modeling} % The model

A Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model is proposed to model dengue 
dynamics.
In the traditional formulation of the model, transmission is governed by a 
constant transmission rate $\beta$ and recovery happens at a rate $\tau$.

For our analysis we chose to let the force of infection vary with time, just 
as it does in the actual epidemics, as seen in the data. So as the epidemic 
progresses, the effective transmission  rate changes and is 
given by 
\begin{equation} 
 \label{eq:effbeta}
 \beta(t) = \frac{R_t\cdot\tau}{S_0}
\end{equation}
where $R_t$ is the effective reproductive number, estimated as 
in~\ref{eq:Rtestimate}.
The complete model with the time-verying force of infection is given by
the system of ordinary differential equations below.
\begin{align}
   \label{eq:model}
 \frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta(t)SI \\     \nonumber
 \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta(t)SI - \tau I&\\      \nonumber
 \frac{dR}{dt} &= \tau I&
\end{align}  
where $S + I + R = 1 \: \forall\: t$. % \in [T_0, T_1]$. 
Of course, this is a rather simplified model, in which, for instance, the 
vector is omitted.
The rationale for this simplification is based on the ability of the 
empirically derived $R_t$  to incorporate the effects of the fluctuating vector 
populations.
Also, although there are multiple circulating serotypes, our approach
can not discriminate between them due to the lack of serotype-specific data.
Nevertheless, this modeling strategy can still provide some insight into the 
disease dynamics and allows us to estimate the initial fraction of susceptibles 
$S_0$.

\subsection*{Bayesian parameter estimation}
We take a Bayesian approach to the estimation of $S_0$.
First the incidence time series was divided into $J=13$ 
epidemic windows that corresponded to significant raises in incidence and 
normalized to lie on the $[0,1]$ interval.
For a given interval $j = \{ t_j^{\text{start}}, t_j^{\text{end}} \} $ we 
observe an incidence time series $\mathbf{Y_{j}}$.
We are thus interested in the posterior distribution
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:S0post}
 p(S_{0j}|\mathbf{Y_{j}}) \propto l(\mathbf{Y_{j}}|S_{0j}, R_t, m, \tau 
)\pi(S_{0j}) 
\end{equation}
The likelihood $l(\mathbf{Y_{j}}|\cdot)$ is assumed to be a Normal distribution 
with fixed variance $\sigma^2$.
In this estimation procedure we kept $R_t$ fixed at fixed at the posterior mean 
obtained as described above and fixed $\tau = 1/7\: \text{days}^{-1}$.
To complete the inference, we need to specify prior distributions for the 
parameters of interest.
We place a flat $\text{Beta}(1, 1)$ prior on $S_{0j}\:\forall j$

To approximate the posterior in~(\ref{eq:S0post}) we use Markov chain Monte 
Carlo techniques implemented in the Bayesian inference with Python 
(BIP)~\cite{pone2011} available at  
\url{http://code.google.com/p/bayesian-inference/}.
BIP uses a Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM)~\cite{vrugt2008} 
scheme that efficiently samples from high-dimensional joint distributions using 
multiple adaptive chains running in parallel with delayed rejection.
Also, as the numerical integration routine implemented within BIP needs 
$\beta(t)$ to be available at 
arbitrary values of $t$, i.e., as continuous function of time because of the 
variable step size, we used linear interpolation to obtain values of $R_t$ for 
any time point.
In this study we used one chain per parameter, i.e, 3 chains for each run.
The chains were run until $5000$ samples were obtained after discarding $500$ 
burn-in samples.
Convergence of the parallel chains was verified at every 100 iterations by the 
calculation of the Gelman-Rubin's R convergence diagnostic~\cite{brooks1998}.

\subsection*{Calculating the attack ratio}

The attack ratio of an epidemic is define by the number of infections divided 
by the size of the population at risk.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:AR}
A=\frac{\text{\# cases}}{\text{Population at risk}} 
\end{equation}

Based on the what has been discussed so far, we can rewrite (\ref{eq:AR}) for 
each epidemic $j$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:AR2}
 A_{j}=\frac{\sum Y_j}{S_{0j}}
\end{equation}
where $S_{0j}$ is the number of susceptibles before each epidemic $j$, which we
estimated as described above.

\section*{Results and Discussion}
 
Figure \ref{fig:rtseries}  shows the $R_t$ series, according to 
(\ref{eq:Rtestimate}). 
It can be seen that the inter-epidemic periods are characterized by $R_t$ being 
indistinguishable from 1.

 \caption{{\bf Estimated time-series for $R_t$, along with 95\% credible 
intervals.} Top panel show reported cases from which $R_t$ is estimated.}
 \label{fig:rtseries}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{Fig:S0}, shows the model from (\ref{eq:model}) fitted to the data. 
In it we can see that the susceptibles series in each epidemic starts at the 
estimated level of $S_0$.
The proportion of susceptibles may seem low, but we 
must remember that these estimates are being affected by an unknown 
underreporting factor, which experts suggest is somewhere between 5 and 10, 
i.e. for every case observed there are 5 or 10 unobserved.
Since this 
underreporting ration affects both the numerator and denominator of 
(\ref{eq:AR}), its effects should cancel out, giving us an unbiased attack ratio 
estimate.
One other possible source of bias which would lead to the 
underestimation of $S_0$ could come from a significant part of the population 
not being exposed to the disease.
However, as we can see in figure \ref{fig:mapas} , the disease spreads pretty 
much homogeneously over 
the entire city (in the last four epidemics, at least).
