	abstract = {Author {SummaryDengue} is the most common disease 
transmitted by a mosquito, with about 100–200 million infections occurring each 
year in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries. Policy-makers require 
accurate information about the number of symptomatic dengue episodes to make 
informed decisions concerning dengue control strategies. But dengue is usually 
underreported by national surveillance systems. Through a systematic literature 
review and analysis of empirical research, we estimated the rate of 
underreporting and the average annual dengue episodes by treatment (hospitalized 
and ambulatory) in 2001–2010, for 12 countries in Southeast Asia. We found an 
average reporting rate of 13.2\% of the total symptomatic dengue episodes in the 
region, leading to an expansion factor of 7.6 for converting reported cases into 
estimated actual cases. While we focused in Southeast Asia, analogous principles 
apply to other regions of the world, and other diseases reported through 
surveillance systems. Estimating the total episodes of dengue is a critical step 
in studying the economic and disease burden of dengue fever, and the 
cost-effectiveness evaluation of dengue control and prevention strategies.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The state of Rio de Janeiro has been important 
since 1986 as a portal for the introduction of dengue virus ({DENV}) into Brazil 
and dissemination of the virus throughout the country. This study describes an 
active surveillance of {DENV} in the state of Rio de Janeiro from 2004 to 2008.
{METHOD}: A total of 14 408 samples from patients suspected to be infected with 
{DENV} were tested by virus isolation, and nested reverse transcriptase 
({RT})-{PCR} assay or anti-{DENV} dengue {IgM} antibody capture {ELISA} 
({MAC}-{ELISA}), or both.
{RESULTS}: By the use of these different methods, a total of 2324 (16.1\%) cases 
were confirmed as dengue infection. The study covers an inter-epidemic period 
(2004-2005), the {DENV}-3 circulation in 2006, the re-emergence of {DENV}-2 in 
2007 and the severe epidemic caused by {DENV}-2 in the summer of 2008. During 
the period, 69 dengue fatal cases were reported, 14 (20.2\%) deaths being 
attributable to {DENV}-3 and 55 (79.7\%) to {DENV}-2.
{CONCLUSION}: Our results emphasize the role of the laboratory in the early 
detection of dengue virus transmission and provide information on the dynamics 
of {DENV} introduction and spread, important for the assessment of intervention 
strategies.},

transmission rates using a Time series {SIR} model},
	volume = {72},
	issn = {0012-9615},
	shorttitle = {Dynamics of measles epidemics},
	abstract = {Before the development of mass-vaccination campaigns, 
measles exhibited persistent fluctuations (endemic dynamics) in large British 
cities, and recurrent outbreaks (episodic dynamics) in smaller communities. The 
critical community size separating the two regimes was ∼300 000-500 000. We 
develop a model, the {TSIR} (Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, 
that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks in measles. The 
model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving 
rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration. It 
is thus a doubly stochastic model for disease dynamics. It further includes 
seasonality in the transmission rates. All parameters of the model are estimated 
on the basis of time series data on reported cases and reconstructed susceptible 
numbers from a set of cities in England and Wales in the prevaccination era 
(1944-1966). The 60 cities analyzed span a size range from London (3.3 × 106 
inhabitants) to Teignmouth (10 500 inhabitants). The dynamics of all cities fit 
the model well. Transmission rates scale with community size, as expected from 
dynamics adhering closely to frequency dependent transmission ("true mass 
action"). These rates are further found to reveal strong seasonal variation, 
corresponding to high transmission during school terms and lower transmission 
during the school holidays. The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is found to be 
invariant across the observed range of host community size, and the mean 
proportion of susceptible individuals also appears to be constant. Through the 
epidemic cycle, the susceptible population is kept within a 3\% interval. The 
disease is, thus, efficient in "regulating" the susceptible population - even in 
small cities that undergo recurrent epidemics with frequent extinction of the 
disease agent. Recolonization is highly sensitive to the random immigration 
process. The initial phase of the epidemic is also stochastic (due to 
demographic stochasticity and random immigration). However, the epidemic is 
nearly "deterministic" through most of the growth and decline phase.},
