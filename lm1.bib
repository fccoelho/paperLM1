transmitted by a mosquito, with about 100–200 million infections occurring each 
year in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries. Policy-makers require 
accurate information about the number of symptomatic dengue episodes to make 
informed decisions concerning dengue control strategies. But dengue is usually 
underreported by national surveillance systems. Through a systematic literature 
review and analysis of empirical research, we estimated the rate of 
underreporting and the average annual dengue episodes by treatment (hospitalized 
and ambulatory) in 2001–2010, for 12 countries in Southeast Asia. We found an 
average reporting rate of 13.2\% of the total symptomatic dengue episodes in the 
region, leading to an expansion factor of 7.6 for converting reported cases into 
estimated actual cases. While we focused in Southeast Asia, analogous principles 
apply to other regions of the world, and other diseases reported through 
surveillance systems. Estimating the total episodes of dengue is a critical step 
in studying the economic and disease burden of dengue fever, and the 
cost-effectiveness evaluation of dengue control and prevention strategies.},

since 1986 as a portal for the introduction of dengue virus ({DENV}) into Brazil 
and dissemination of the virus throughout the country. This study describes an 
active surveillance of {DENV} in the state of Rio de Janeiro from 2004 to 2008.
{METHOD}: A total of 14 408 samples from patients suspected to be infected with 
{DENV} were tested by virus isolation, and nested reverse transcriptase 
({RT})-{PCR} assay or anti-{DENV} dengue {IgM} antibody capture {ELISA} 
({MAC}-{ELISA}), or both.
{RESULTS}: By the use of these different methods, a total of 2324 (16.1\%) cases 
were confirmed as dengue infection. The study covers an inter-epidemic period 
(2004-2005), the {DENV}-3 circulation in 2006, the re-emergence of {DENV}-2 in 
2007 and the severe epidemic caused by {DENV}-2 in the summer of 2008. During 
the period, 69 dengue fatal cases were reported, 14 (20.2\%) deaths being 
attributable to {DENV}-3 and 55 (79.7\%) to {DENV}-2.
{CONCLUSION}: Our results emphasize the role of the laboratory in the early 
detection of dengue virus transmission and provide information on the dynamics 
of {DENV} introduction and spread, important for the assessment of intervention 
strategies.},

	shorttitle = {Dynamics of measles epidemics},
	abstract = {Before the development of mass-vaccination campaigns, 
measles exhibited persistent fluctuations (endemic dynamics) in large British 
cities, and recurrent outbreaks (episodic dynamics) in smaller communities. The 
critical community size separating the two regimes was ∼300 000-500 000. We 
develop a model, the {TSIR} (Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model, 
that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic outbreaks in measles. The 
model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving 
rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration. It 
is thus a doubly stochastic model for disease dynamics. It further includes 
seasonality in the transmission rates. All parameters of the model are estimated 
on the basis of time series data on reported cases and reconstructed susceptible 
numbers from a set of cities in England and Wales in the prevaccination era 
(1944-1966). The 60 cities analyzed span a size range from London (3.3 × 106 
inhabitants) to Teignmouth (10 500 inhabitants). The dynamics of all cities fit 
the model well. Transmission rates scale with community size, as expected from 
dynamics adhering closely to frequency dependent transmission ("true mass 
action"). These rates are further found to reveal strong seasonal variation, 
corresponding to high transmission during school terms and lower transmission 
during the school holidays. The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is found to be 
invariant across the observed range of host community size, and the mean 
proportion of susceptible individuals also appears to be constant. Through the 
epidemic cycle, the susceptible population is kept within a 3\% interval. The 
disease is, thus, efficient in "regulating" the susceptible population - even in 
small cities that undergo recurrent epidemics with frequent extinction of the 
disease agent. Recolonization is highly sensitive to the random immigration 
process. The initial phase of the epidemic is also stochastic (due to 
demographic stochasticity and random immigration). However, the epidemic is 
nearly "deterministic" through most of the growth and decline phase.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}  Dengue dynamics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as in 
many dengue-endemic regions of the world, is seasonal, with peaks during the 
wet-hot months. This temporal pattern is generally attributed to the dynamics of 
its mosquito vector Aedes aegypti (L.). The objectives of this study were to 
characterize the temporal pattern of Ae. aegypti population dynamics in three 
neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro and its association with local meteorological 
variables; and to compare positivity and density indices obtained with ovitraps 
and {MosquiTraps}. The three neighborhoods are distinct in vegetation coverage, 
sanitation, water supply, and urbanization. Mosquito sampling was carried out 
weekly, from September 2006 to March 2008, a period during which large dengue 
epidemics occurred in the city. Our results show peaks of oviposition in early 
summer 2007 and late summer 2008, detected by both traps. The ovitrap provided a 
more sensitive index than {MosquiTrap}. The {MosquiTrap} detection threshold 
showed high variation among areas, corresponding to a mean egg density of ≈25–52 
eggs per ovitrap. Both temperature and rainfall were significantly related to 
Ae. aegypti indices at a short (1 wk) time lag. Our results suggest that mean 
weekly temperature above 22–24°C is strongly associated with high Ae. aegypti 
abundance and consequently with an increased risk of dengue transmission. 
Understanding the effects of meteorological variables on Ae. aegypti population 
dynamics will help to target control measures at the times when vector 
populations are greatest, contributing to the development of climate-based 
control and surveillance measures for dengue fever in a hyperendemic area.},

epidemics which have an annual period (like the seasonality), we prove 
inequalities which show that the attack rate is close to that of the 
non-seasonal model, so that it is nearly independent of the strength of the 
forcing, despite the fact that the shape of the epidemic curve depends strongly 
on the degree of seasonality of the forcing. Numerical simulations show that 
this holds to an even stronger extent than is implied by our rigorous results. 
When the system has subharmonic or chaotic solutions, we show that similar 
results hold when the attack rate is replaced by the average attack rate over 
several years. Consequences of these findings for analyzing the effect of

tends to 0 when ℛ0{\textless}1 and the initial fraction of infected people tends 
to 0. When ℛ0{\textgreater}1, the final epidemic size is bigger than the 
fraction 1−1/ℛ0 of the initially nonimmune population. In summary, the basic 
reproduction number ℛ0 keeps its classical threshold property but many other 
properties are no longer true in a seasonal environment. These theoretical 
results should be kept in mind when analyzing data for emerging vector-borne 
diseases (West-Nile, dengue, chikungunya) or air-borne diseases ({SARS}, 
pandemic influenza); all these diseases being influenced by seasonality.},

	abstract = {Using mathematical models to extend knowledge of pathogen 
transmission and recommend optimized control efforts is dependent on the 
accuracy of model parameters. The rate at which susceptible individuals become 
infected [the force of infection ({FoI})] is one of the most important 
parameters, but due to data constraints it is often incorrectly assumed to be 
constant over time. Using a bespoke method for a 12-y longitudinal dataset of 
serotype-specific dengue virus ({DENV}) infections, we estimated time-varying, 
serotype-specific {FoIs} for all four {DENV} serotypes. The {FoI} varied 
markedly in time, which implies that {DENV} transmission dynamics are complex 
and are best summarized using time-dependent transmission parameters. Our 
results provide more accurate measures of virus transmission dynamics and a 
basis for improving selection of control and disease prevention strategies., 
Infectious disease models play a key role in public health planning. These 
models rely on accurate estimates of key transmission parameters such as the 
force of infection ({FoI}), which is the per-capita risk of a susceptible person 
being infected. The {FoI} captures the fundamental dynamics of transmission and 
is crucial for gauging control efforts, such as identifying vaccination targets. 
Dengue virus ({DENV}) is a mosquito-borne, multiserotype pathogen that currently 
infects ∼390 million people a year. Existing estimates of the {DENV} {FoI} are 
inaccurate because they rely on the unrealistic assumption that risk is constant 
over time. Dengue models are thus unreliable for designing vaccine deployment 
strategies. Here, we present to our knowledge the first time-varying (daily), 
serotype-specific estimates of {DENV} {FoIs} using a spline-based fitting 
procedure designed to examine a 12-y, longitudinal {DENV} serological dataset 
from Iquitos, Peru (11,703 individuals, 38,416 samples, and 22,301 
serotype-specific {DENV} infections from 1999 to 2010). The yearly {DENV} {FoI} 
varied markedly across time and serotypes (0–0.33), as did daily basic 
reproductive numbers (0.49–4.72). During specific time periods, the {FoI} 
fluctuations correlated across serotypes, indicating that different {DENV} 
serotypes shared common transmission drivers. The marked variation in 
transmission intensity that we detected indicates that intervention targets 
based on one-time estimates of the {FoI} could underestimate the level of effort 
needed to prevent disease. Our description of dengue virus transmission dynamics 
is unprecedented in detail, providing a basis for understanding the persistence 
of this rapidly emerging pathogen and improving disease prevention programs.},

	abstract = {Objectives  To assess the dengue burden in Brazil, and to 
compare it over three spatial scales: in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the state 
of Rio de Janeiro, and in Brazil overall. Methods  We calculated disability 
adjusted life years ({DALYs}) lost to dengue per million individuals annually 
from 1986 through 2006. To calculate {DALYs}, we compiled data on the number of 
dengue cases by age, clinical syndrome and outcome. We evaluated the sensitivity 
of our results to multiplication factors used to adjust for inaccuracies in 
reporting using a Monte Carlo method. Results  From 1986 through 2006, a mean of 
56, 47 and 22 {DALYs} per million individuals annually were lost to dengue in 
the city of Rio de Janeiro, in the state of Rio de Janeiro and in Brazil, 
respectively. Over 80\% of the dengue burden derived from dengue fever cases. 
The dengue burden was highest at the city-level with a maximum single-year 
estimate of 560 {DALYs} per million individuals for 2002. Conclusions  
Assessment of dengue burden requires consideration of all clinical syndromes 
over multiple years. Our results indicate that the dengue burden is as high as 
the burden of other major infectious diseases that afflict the Brazilian 
population, including malaria. These results may prompt policy makers to elevate 
the prioritization of dengue control, and allocate resources needed to curtail 
the increasing dengue burden.},
