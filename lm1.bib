However, in any epidemic, there may exist a number of individuals who may not be involved in the transmission of the disease. In this note we show how maximum likelihood estimators can be derived for the parameters of interest. The proposed methodology is then applied to the Abakaliki smallpox data in Nigeria.},

The results are confirmed in simulations of major epidemics. An application to a data set on smallpox is given.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryDengue} is the most common disease 
transmitted by a mosquito, with about 100–200 million infections occurring each 
year in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries. Policy-makers require 
accurate information about the number of symptomatic dengue episodes to make 
informed decisions concerning dengue control strategies. But dengue is usually 
underreported by national surveillance systems. Through a systematic literature 
review and analysis of empirical research, we estimated the rate of 
underreporting and the average annual dengue episodes by treatment (hospitalized 
and ambulatory) in 2001–2010, for 12 countries in Southeast Asia. We found an 
average reporting rate of 13.2\% of the total symptomatic dengue episodes in the 
region, leading to an expansion factor of 7.6 for converting reported cases into 
estimated actual cases. While we focused in Southeast Asia, analogous principles 
apply to other regions of the world, and other diseases reported through 
surveillance systems. Estimating the total episodes of dengue is a critical step 
in studying the economic and disease burden of dengue fever, and the 
cost-effectiveness evaluation of dengue control and prevention strategies.},
